                                            <p> We have chosen to stand together outside of Toronto's downtown core for the purpose of 
						honouring Black lives lost. We choose to do this because we have been systematically displaced 
						from the downtown core's social & economic life and insufficiently included in its development 
						over the last 20 years. We view its success as a global site for real estate investment as parasitic 
						on Black creativity and 'coolness'. We can perform downtown but not live there en masse. 
						Therefore, we have chosen to take our protest outside of this performative domain and into 
						the city's segregated outer suburbs, where most of its Black citizens reside. 
					   </p>

                                            <p> We dedicate this space to all Black lives lost to the spectacular and non-spectacular physical 
						and psychological violence of anti-Black racists & systems of white supremacy. We hold this space 
						to be a commune between the living and not-living. We consecrate any space we take up as sacred by 
						virtue of our presence. We honour all ancestors lost before their time.

                                            <p> The quietism that we will be embracing will not invoke the telling of new narratives of how we 
						can better be included into the human family. However, we will rather embrace silence as a protest 
						to the various historical narratives that have required for us to literally and figuratively die for 
						the rest of the world to live. We will contemplate on this unsavoury state of affairs and create space 
						for that reality to speak. Albeit, for the purposes of sketching out what Black liberation(s) may look like.

                                            <p> We have temporarily suspended our rich African tradition of call and response. 
						We do this in part because the call has been rendered inaudible, muffled and mumbled by 
						our inability to make sense of the suffering we have endured in the world. Rather the muffled 
						call makes the sound of a war drum. We merely seek to clear the air of false clarion calls & 
						to collectively hear the sound of the drum.

                                            <p> Yet this is not a call to action this is a call to stand with one another. 
						We rebuke having to always have solutions to problems we have not had a hand in creating. 
						We forfeit from engaging in this performative approach to being in the world. 
						It is an unregistered violence in the psyche of the performer. 
						We seek reprieve from this unsaid and always occurring violence.

						We are open to the possibility of creating that which has not been thought, 
						of creating that which can only bloom to life through quiet contemplation, 
						non-judgement and generous dialogue with one another.
